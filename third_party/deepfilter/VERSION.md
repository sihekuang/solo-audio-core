## Build notes

Two adjustments were required against an unmodified `v0.5.6` clone:

1. `cargo update -p time` to pull `time v0.3.28 -> v0.3.44`. The pinned version in the upstream `Cargo.lock` does not compile on rustc 1.95.
2. Added `crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]` to `libDF/Cargo.toml`'s `[lib]` section so a `.dylib` is emitted. Upstream relies on `cargo-c` to produce the shared library; we bypass that and use plain `cargo build` plus `cbindgen` for the header.

The C header was generated separately with `cbindgen --config cbindgen.toml --crate deep_filter --output deep_filter.h` (cbindgen 0.29.2). Static helpers `df_coef_size` and `df_gain_size` are intentionally excluded by upstream from the C ABI (no `#[no_mangle]`) and do not appear in the header.
